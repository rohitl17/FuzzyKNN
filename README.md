Implementation of FuzzyKNN algorithm from a research paper

Everyone is aware of the KNN algorithm which is the traditional approach in supervised learning for classifying data. Here, I have taken the iris dataset which is in tabular format and implemented the Fuzzy KNN algorithm from a research paper which I read back in 2016. The code for the same is included in the repo.
